# Colors Fight

It's the old popular Pong game but with a different automated approach. There will be 4 colors fighting each other to expand their teritory. It is based on Javascript Canvas.
Just run the `html` file and keep staring at it.

## Credits

The idea came from [@vnglst X Post](https://x.com/vnglst/status/1751278052154179770?s=20), that inspired me to try it out and see if I can make a good collision detection between a circle and a rectangle. 

The color pallete came from *Google* brand colors.

## Demo

Here is a [live experience](https://hmak-dev.github.io/color-fight/) of this little project.
